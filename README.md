Snow simulation for CIS563: Physically Based Animation

For this project I chose to do two simulations using the Material Point Method: two jello cubes colliding, and two snow cubes colliding. Both were implemented in Taichi, and extrapolated code written from a 2D example of an elastic cube in Taichi using the same method. 

Code outputs sequence of poly files reperesenting the simulation over a number of frames. Used Houdini Apprentice to visualize poly files and render them into animated videos, as well as to apply post-processing effects such as surface texture, color, and lighting.
