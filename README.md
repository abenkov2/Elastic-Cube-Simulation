Snow simulation for CIS563: Physically Based Animation

For this project I chose to do two simulations using the Material Point Method: two jello cubes colliding, and two snow cubes colliding. Both were implemented in Taichi, and extrapolated code written from a 2D example of an elastic cube in Taichi using the same method.
